// we can see 2 types of data types here one is primitive(call by value) and another one is non-primitive that is (call by reference)
//1.null 2.BigInt 3.boolean 4.string 5.undefined 6.Number 7.symbol( primitive datatypes)

//Array,Object,function are the non- primitive datatypes.Array

//we define array as :-
const arr =["shakti","deva","hero"]
console.log(arr)

//we define onject as
const heros={
eName:"hitesh",
eAge:"33"
 //we write object in key value pair
}
console.log(heros)

//we define arrays as
const myFunction = function(){
    
    console.log("hello javascript");
}
myFunction();
